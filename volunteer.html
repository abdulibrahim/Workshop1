    <p>
      Thank you for your interest in volunteering with the Pet Rescue Organization to give your time and love to the animals in our care. We rely on our wonderful volunteers to help with many aspects of our shelter operations. Without our volunteers, we couldn’t do all the good things we do.

Pet Rescue Organization volunteers provide vital loving care to dogs and cats at the Pet Rescue Organization Adoption Center, located in New York City’s Upper East Side. Our volunteers make such a difference by enriching the animals' time at the shelter and helping to place them in new homes</p>
<p>
  All volunteer opportunities are in New York City. Individuals unable to volunteer in New York City should contact their local animal welfare organization. To find a shelter near you, please visit petfinder.com and click on the Shelters & Rescues tab</p>
  <p>Applications are accepted online only and on a quarterly basis (see Steps to Becoming a Volunteer below)</p>
  <p> Volunteers must be at least 16 years old.</p>
  <p>Volunteers must be able to commit to a minimum of eight hours per month for a minimum of six months. Due to the extensive training requirements, we are not able to accept short-term volunteers or group projects.</p>
  <p>The ASPCA does not accept volunteers needing to fulfill court-appointed community service.</p>
