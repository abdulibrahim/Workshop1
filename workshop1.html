			Coffee Region of Ethiopia
		Ethiopia
		The three major growing regions here are Harrar, Sidamo, and Yirgacheffe, which all come from the Ethiopian Highlands at between four and seven thousand feet.

		Harrar coffees are dry-processed coffees and tend to come from old varietal typica coffee trees. These coffees are noted for their big body and sometimes extremely "wild" fruity finish.

		Sidamo and Yirgacheffe coffees are for the most part wet-processed coffees and both tend to have a floral/berry finish going for them depending on the given crop year.</p>
